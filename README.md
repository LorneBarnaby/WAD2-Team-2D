## Setup Guide

Simply run the population script, this functions as both a population script for dummy user data, and a script that will insert sample prizes and achievements for your users to win! If you wish to make your own prizes and achievements, take a look at the structure of the AW_PopData.py file in setup/scripts, or use the admin functionality in django.
